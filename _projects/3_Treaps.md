## Summary

A project aimed at implementing the Treap as a generic data structure along with the different functionalities of a treap. Treap is a data structure that stores pairs (say [X,Y]) in a binary tree such that it is a binary search tree by X and a binary heap by Y. The entire treap and its individual nodes were built as generic canonical classes, thereby supporting all the different data types. The project involved the implementation of multiple operations such as insert node, delete node, split treap, merge two treaps, union, intersection, difference and traversal of treaps. A bidirectional iterator was implemented as a nested class within the treap class. Multiple member algorithms such as find and replace were implemented for treaps. This project was implemented as part of the Generic Programming Course during my Undergraduate Study.
