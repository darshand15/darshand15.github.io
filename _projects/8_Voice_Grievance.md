## Problem Statement

 * The citizens and members of local communities encounter frequent domestic problems that can range from the petty to the most serious and time-critical. A few examples of the problems are as follows:
    * The street lights on the road may not be working
    * The water supply might be irregular
    * The robberies in the neighbourhood might have increased
    * A short circuit might have occured resulting in a dangerous fire, etc
 * It is imperative that the concerned authorities are intimated immediately and the problem be rectified to ensure a smooth functioning of the society
 * But the citizens often find it confusing and troublesome to address these issues to the right department
 * They are often unaware of who, where and how a particular problem should be reported
 * There are often endless delegations wherein a department transfers the complainant to another and so on. This coupled with the inconveniences involved makes the entire process lengthy, cumbersome and ineffective and can result in dangerous consequences due to the delay in addressing the problems.
