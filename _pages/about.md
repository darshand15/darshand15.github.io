Hello! I am a first-year student in the **Master of Science program in Computer Science Courant** at <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://cs.nyu.edu/home/">New York University (Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences)</a>.

I previously worked as a *Researcher and Developer* for the *Platform and Software Research* team under 6G Lab at <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://research.samsung.com/sri-b">Samsung Research</a>. In this role, I actively researched various advanced topics of interest like SIMD and Vector Processing, Compilers and Compiler Optimizations, LLVM and custom LLVM passes for optimization, with the overall objective of developing the platforms and software for the next generation of Wireless Communication to support stratospheric data rates of 100 Gbps. 

My Undergraduate Study was at <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.pes.edu">PES University</a>, where I graduated in the top 5% in 2022, receiving a *First Class with Honors*, B. Tech Degree in *"Computer Science and Engineering"*, and a Specialization in *"Systems and Core Computing"*.

My technical interests broadly fall under the **Performance Optimization** umbrella and include such performance-motivated areas as *Systems and Networking, High-Performance Computing, Compilers, Parallel-Computing, Distributed Systems, Operating Systems, and Computer Architecture*. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have consciously tailored my courses, projects, and research explorations in this direction of performance optimization. This journey has resulted in the ossification of my technical identity and the enhancement of my research acumen. I am excited to continue exploring under the Performance Optimization umbrella as part of my MSCS program at NYU Courant.

Further, I firmly believe that technology can serve as a force for good and effortlessly solve pressing real-world problems such as Food, Water, Education, Poverty, Healthcare, Climate Change, Sustainability, etc. In this regard, I am passionately motivated to transcend boundaries and transform my hunger for optimization into a mindset for efficiently solving such problems.
