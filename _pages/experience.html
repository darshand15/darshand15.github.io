## Samsung R&D Institute India - Bangalore (May 2021 - July 2021)
  * Student Trainee at IoT App, IoT Platform and Connectivity Team
  * Project Title: Improving the User Experience via the Smart Things IoT Ecosystem. Building an alternate and effective solution to solve a particular use case with respect to the Smart Things Application.
  * Problem Statement: Virtual meetings, discussions, online academic classes, etc. are commonplace now, especially after the pandemic. A number of different situations may arise after joining a video call as follows:
    * The background lighting may not be optimal. The conventional way to solve this would involve switching on/off lights, changing brightness settings if possible and closing window curtains.
    * There could be a glare on the screen. The conventional way to solve this would involve switching on/off lights, changing brightness settings if possible and closing window curtains.
    * The Air Conditioner / Fan setting may not be optimal. The conventional way to solve this would involve switching on/off the AC/Fan, changing the speed of the Fan, changing the temperature of the AC.
  * The solutions to these above problems can be broadly categorized as follows:
    * Manual intervention to switch on/off devices or change their settings using the provided interfaces like switches, regulators, etc.
    * Switching to the Smart Things Application and controlling the devices as required in the case of smart devices
  * These solutions are tedious, time-consuming and inefficient. Moreover, they disrupt the user's participation in the video call/meeting.
  * The proposed solution is as follows:
