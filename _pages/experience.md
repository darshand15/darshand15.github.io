## Samsung R&D Institute India - Bangalore (Jan 2022 - July 2022)
  * Student Trainee at AI Vision Solutions, Vision Research, CTO
  * Problem Statement: Building a Photorealistic Data Engine for the purpose of Depth Estimation.
  * Under the guidance and mentorship of Alok Shukla (Head of Part / Director, AI Vision Solutions, SRI-Bangalore), Pankaj Kumar Bajpai (Architect, AI Vision Solutions, SRI-Bangalore) and Kunal Swami (Chief Engineer, AI Vision Solutions, SRI-Bangalore)

## PES University - Bangalore (Jan 2022 - May 2022)
  * Teaching Assistant for the course - Design and Analysis of Algorithms
  * Under the guidance and mentorship of Prof. NSK and Prof. Channa Bankapur

## Samsung R&D Institute India - Bangalore (May 2021 - July 2021)
  * Student Trainee at IoT App, IoT Platform and Connectivity Team
  * Project Title: Improving the User Experience via the Smart Things IoT Ecosystem. Building an alternate and effective solution to solve a particular use case with respect to the Smart Things Application.
  * Problem Statement: Virtual meetings, discussions, online academic classes, etc. are commonplace now, especially after the pandemic. A number of different situations may arise after joining a video call as follows:
    * The background lighting may not be optimal. The conventional way to solve this would involve switching on/off lights, changing brightness settings if possible and closing window curtains.
    * There could be a glare on the screen. The conventional way to solve this would involve switching on/off lights, changing brightness settings if possible and closing window curtains.
    * The Air Conditioner / Fan setting may not be optimal. The conventional way to solve this would involve switching on/off the AC/Fan, changing the speed of the Fan, changing the temperature of the AC.
  * The solutions to these above problems can be broadly categorized as follows:
    * Manual intervention to switch on/off devices or change their settings using the provided interfaces like switches, regulators, etc.
    * Switching to the Smart Things Application and controlling the devices as required in the case of smart devices
  * These solutions are tedious, time-consuming and inefficient. Moreover, they disrupt the user's participation in the video call/meeting.
  * The proposed solution is as follows:

  * Under the guidance and mentorship of MSSK Sharma (Head of Part / Director, IoT App, SRI-Bangalore) and Neeraj Pandey (Senior Chief Engineer, IoT App, SRI-Bangalore)

## Centre for Data Science and Applied Machine Learning, PES University - Bangalore (May 2019 - July 2019)
  * Research Intern at the Centre for Data Science and Applied Machine Learning
  * Problem Statement: Using Relative Monocular Depth Perception and Object Tracking to perform simulations in a Physics Engine such as Unreal.
  * Detected and perceived relative depth of objects from a single camera using relative monocular depth perception.
  * Identified and Recognized objects using the YOLO model.
  * Tracked objects using a Multi Object Tracker and openCV.
  * Simulated the events occurring after the end of the video in Unreal Engine by estimating the three-dimensional kinematic parameters of the objects.
  * Provides better analysis of events through simulation.
  * Under the guidance and mentorship of Dr. Shylaja and Prof. Ramadevi
